### 📝 Abstract
Content creators face challenges in predicting the success of their investments on platforms like TikTok. Our project introduces a **multimodal ensemble model** that leverages video encoding and natural language processing to predict video virality with high accuracy. The findings validate the potential of multimodal approaches over traditional unimodal methods.

### ✨ Key Highlights
- **🎯 Objective**: Predict TikTok video virality using a multimodal ensemble model.  
- **🛠️ Approach**:  
  - Late fusion technique for effective integration of audio, visual, and textual modalities.  
  - Advanced video encoding and natural language processing models.  
- **🌟 Impact**: Demonstrates the benefits of multimodal data fusion for predicting social media content success.
